# Memory test

This test is designed to test the memory of the user. There are 3 different levels to the test - easy, medium, hard. Each level displays a grid and then asks the user 5 different multiple choice questions on the grid. 

The test score is calculated based on the speed and accuracy of the user. Once the user has completed the test, their score is compared to others through my Firebase database.

Please note that the kernal has to be restarded every time the test is run.
